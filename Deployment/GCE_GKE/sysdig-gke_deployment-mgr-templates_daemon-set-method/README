The Deployment Manager (DM) templates in this folder can be used to automatically deploy Sysdig Cloud across an existing Kubernetes cluster on GKE (Google Container Engine) using Daemon Sets.

The minimum version required for Kubernetes on GKE is 1.2

If you are using an older version of Kubernetes, you'll need to the use the Replication Controller (RC) based DM templates in the alternate folder in this repo.


Follow these steps:

1) Fill in the appropriate information for your cluster in cluster.yaml. Your cluster's API server IP address and authentication can be found in the Google Cloud Platform console in the details for your cluster under "Endpoint".

2) Use cluster.yaml to deploy the DM types that will allow you to create resources in your cluster:

  $ gcloud deployment-manager deployments create cluster-types --config cluster.yaml

This will create two types for interacting with the Kubernetes APIs:

- <cluster-name>-v1 (for interacting with the normal v1 API)
- <cluster-name>-extensions-v1beta1 (for interacting with the extensions API)

3) Fill in the appropriate information in sysdig.yaml. Be sure that the cluster property is the same cluster name used in step (1). Note, you must select one of your slave nodes as the delegate node - this node will host the Sysdig Cloud agent that will actually ping back to the API server to collect the metadata exposed there. 

4) Use sysdig.yaml to deploy the daemonset:

  $ gcloud deployment-manager deployments create sysdig --config sysdig.yaml

After a short period (minutes at most), you should see data from your cluster being reported in the Sysdig Cloud app.
